## How YOLO Works

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection system that:
- Processes images in a single neural network evaluation (real-time speed)
- Divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes/class probabilities
- Uses anchor boxes to predict multiple objects in the same grid cell
- Achieves high accuracy with efficient computation

For crowd counting, we specifically:
1. Process each video frame through the YOLOv3 network
2. Filter detections to only include "person" class
3. Apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to eliminate duplicate detections
4. Count remaining boxes as our crowd estimate

## Why Use YOLO for Crowd Counting

1. **Real-time Performance**: YOLO is significantly faster than R-CNN variants
2. **Good Accuracy**: Balances speed and detection quality effectively
3. **Single-Stage Detection**: Processes the entire image at once
4. **Generalization**: Works well on various crowd densities
5. **Open Implementation**: Easily customizable for specific needs

Traditional methods like background subtraction or Haar cascades struggle with:
- Occlusions in dense crowds
- Varying lighting conditions
- Different person orientations
- Scale variations
